It will return "foo is 3, bar is 42" every time since the parameters foo and bar are assigned undefined and null in the function expression

WRONG

This is only the case for show(); (i.e. when there are no arguments passed and the default param values are used)

For the other cases

show(5, 7);  // => foo is 5, bar is 7
show(0, 0);  // => foo is 0, bar is 0
show(4);     // => foo is 4, bar is 42
